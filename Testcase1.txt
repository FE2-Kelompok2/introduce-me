Narration is the use of a written or spoken commentary to convey a story to an audience.

Narration is conveyed by a narator:
a specific person or unspecified literartcy voice,
developed by the creator of the story, to deliver information to the audience,
particularly about the plot (the series of events).

Narration is a required element of all written stories
(novels, short stories, poems, memoirs, etc.), with the function of conveying the story
in its entirety. However, naration is merely optional
in most other storyteling formats,
such as films, plays, television shows, and video games,

The narative mode encompases the set of choices through which the creator of
the story develops their narator and naration:
Narative point of view, perspective, or voice: the choice of grammatical person used by
the narator to establish the whether
or not the narator and the audience are participants
in the story; also, this includes the scope of the information or knowledge that the narator presents
